Warsaw Night Half Marathon Analysis and Prediction Project

As a passionate runner and data enthusiast, I'm combining my love for running with data science to analyze and predict outcomes for the Warsaw Night Half Marathon. This project marks my first venture into competitive running and is an opportunity to see how data can provide insights into performance.

Project Overview
I'm analyzing race results from 2018, 2019, 2022, and 2023, focusing on trends and patterns in the performances of top athletes. Using Python for data manipulation and visualization, I’m exploring how the race has evolved over time.

Future Plans
Next, I plan to develop a machine learning model that correlates race results with weather data to predict outcomes for the 2024 event. Additionally, I’ll conduct an experimental simulation to predict my own performance in the race, using data from my training sessions.

Why This Project?
This project is a blend of my passion for running, my interest in data analysis, and my skills in Python. As I prepare for my first half marathon, I’m excited to see how well data can guide and predict race outcomes, including my own.
